# Clash of Command

# Overview
This game started off as a code sample that had three goals: to be a sample submission for the UWO Computer Science Department, to be a quick refresher on Java syntax for me,  and to serve as a very, very, very alpha-level skeleton of an old-school command-line RPG battle simulator I have been meaning to make for a while now (think a mix between the old Flash game "Epic Battle Fantasy" (wow I feel old saying that...) and late-70's text-adventure style of games).

# There is A LOT I will add over time, such as:

  * multiple foes
  * multiple PCs,
  * items,
  * a story,
  * bosses,
  * other stats,
  * ASCII art (this one is a HARD maybe),
  * other goodies,
  * and most importantly, more sassy one-liners.
I (probablly) will not add any GUI aspects to this. There are a PLETHORA of other games that have amazing eye-candy (and I have no pixel art talent...).

# Anyways,
I do not plan on contributing to this project often, but it serves as a skelleton for anyone else who wants to modify and incorperate it into thier projects.

Thank you for taking a look at this, and have a great day!
