# Yet-to-be-Named-Battle-Sim UWO sample code edition
This is a code sample that has three goals: to be a sample submission for the UWO Computer Science Department, to be a quick refresher on Java syntax for me, 
and to serve as a very, very, very alpha-level skeleton of an old-school command-line RPG battle simulator I have been meaning to make for a while now 
(think a mix between the old Flash game "Epic Battle Fantasy" (wow I feel old saying that...) and late-70's text-adventure style of games).

I wanted to make sure I highlighted the basic use of user I/O, objects, 2-D arrays, basic exception handeling, loops, and other Java basics covered in a first and second 
semester CS class all while keeping the code short and having an actuall purpose. 
As such, some design choices are sub-optimal for the project's end goal, but that will be changed as I expand the size of the game.

I could not fit EVERY point that I wanted to in order to cover all the topics in a two-semester class into this small project; that being said, 
the actuall math and logic of the simulator works as I intended it to.

There is A LOT I will add over time, such as:

  multiple foes,
  multiple PCs,
  items,
  a story,
  bosses,
  other stats,
  ASCII art (this one is a HARD maybe),
  other goodies,
  and most importantly, more sassy one-liners.
  
I (probablly) will not add any GUI aspects to this. There are a PLETHORA of other games that have amazing eye-candy (and I have no pixel art talent...).

Anyways,

Thank you for taking a look at this, and have a great day!
